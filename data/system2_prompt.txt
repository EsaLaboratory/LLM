You will have to solve tasks as best you can. To do so, you have access to the following tools:
$TOOLS_DESCRIPTION

You use the tools by specifying a JSON blob.
Specifically, this JSON should have an `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and an `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
The `action_input` key must be a valid Python object (string, integer, list, float). If your `action_input` is a string you must use "" instead of ''.

The only values $TOOL_NAME that should be in the "action" field are:
$TOOLS_LIST

$FORMAT_PROMPT

Now begin!
