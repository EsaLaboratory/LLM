The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action and MUST be formatted as markdown, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
```
{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}
```
Make sure to have the $INPUT in the right format for the tool you are using, and is a correct JSON input.
The $JSON_BLOB must be formatted as markdown and only use a SINGLE action at a time.
